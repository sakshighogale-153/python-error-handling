# Python File Handling Assignment

This project contains two tasks about file handling and exceptions in Python.

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
- Opens a file named `sample.txt`
- Reads and prints the file line by line
- Handles the error if the file does not exist using try-except

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
- Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`
- Appends additional text to the same file
- Reads and displays the final content of the file

## How to Run

2. Run Task 1:
   python task1.py
3. Run Task 2:
   python task2.py
